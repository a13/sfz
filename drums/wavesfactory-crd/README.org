* WTF?
Linux-specific files for [[http://www.wavesfactory.com/classic-rock-drums.php][Wavesfactory Classic Rock Drums]] (Ludwig Vistalite drum kit with a Supraphonic snare and Zildjian cymbals).

* What's inside?

** Samples?
No Samples included, sorry. You have to buy your own copy, download and extract "Samples" directory here.

** Sfz mappings

8 sfz files, one per microphone

** Linuxsampler script

Linuxsampler doesn't like relative paths, so we have to generate script ourselves:
#+NAME: howto
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd linuxsampler
make
#+END_SRC

** Non-mixer

Non-mixer project, for panning only so far.

* Plans :)

** TODO Non-connections (LS->Non-Mixer)

** TODO Ardour templates

** TODO Muse/Non-sequencer mappings

** Whatever
